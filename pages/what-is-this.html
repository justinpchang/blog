      <p><span class="newthought">I always wanted</span> to be the kind of person that journals. Nevermind the therapeutic benefits of journalling, I just wanted to have a time capsule of the kinds of problems I faced or what seemed important to me at different points in my life. Starting a journal has been my New Year's resolution for at least 10 years by now. Unfortunately, due to either my laziness, procrastination or all around inability to stick to most hobbies, journalling has never really been a part of my life. I've tried blogging in the past, as well. Maybe the technical format would appeal to me more, or maybe the public nature of a blog on the Internet, but that, too, proved useless. But, now, we are here on this blog for my nth attempt.</p>
      <p>This blog is somewhat bourne of the observation that as I get older, I enjoy these "old" kind of things more. I forced it when I was younger: drinking disgusting black coffee until I liked it because adults (in purely the abstract form of the word) enjoy it. Now, as an adult (again, completely abstract) myself, it seems more natural. This yearning hasn't yielded any fruit in the way of journalling so far, but I'm hoping that I've reached the threshold where this becomes something I greatly enjoy doing.</p>
      <p>My most recent attempt at this was a <a href="http://www.justinpchang.com">Squarespace blog</a> that I built mostly for job recruiters to look at and hire me. It was a sleek looking blog (completely built on the editor without touching HTML, but how could they know that?) that was a truly thin veil over my CV. If you navigate there now, the background yellow is absolutely abhorrent and the sans-serif font looks so stupid, but it is what it is. On the "blog" section of the site, I have still only posted a single entry about a technical project I did in high school. But multiple interviewers have asked me about it, so I guess it wasn't a failure in that regard. I also shudder at the thought of having a personal blog that I list under the "Websites" section of LinkedIn for all my future rejectors to read. Quel cauchemar. Chances are, if you're reading this, I've sent you the link to this personally. Or maybe I'll never send it out and the only people who will ever know where this is located is me and Sofia, who may also post entries maybe and to whom I've already sent the link.</p>
      <p>That's another thing that I haven't tried yet: group blogs. I've slowly made every difficult thing in my life partner or group based in order to "keep myself accountable." Working out is a lot easier when there is someone working out with you. Dieting is a lot easier when you tell people about it and they expect progress. I'm a little iffy on the latter and how it sometimes feels like using people who don't want to hear about my diets, but like, whatever. It works. And hopefully it will work here. Of course, I won't be able to post about personal things like a diary, but not confronting my personal problems has always been my style anyways.</p>
      <br />
      <p><span class="newthought">Now, on to the technical aspects.</span> In the past, I have tried everything like Weebly, Wordpress, Squarespace, Github Pages with Jekyll, and those weird personal Google home pages around when I was in middle school (what happened to those??). I realize that the platform I used wasn't what hindered me from actually posting entries on those blogs, but maybe this will help a little?</p>
      <p>This blog is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, a free static website hosting service. I would have used Github Pages again, but I have some other stuff living on my free subdomain that I don't want to bother. Netlify restricts me in the capabilities of the blog, but I think I prefer this kind of minimalist approach. Just look around this page as proof: there isn't even a back button!</p>
      <p>As a static website, this whole blog is built completely with HTML, CSS and just a tiny bit of Javascript on the home page for automatically creating post snippets. In terms of styling, the sites uses a barely-edited, out-of-the-box copy of <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a>, a stylesheet that implements the design philosophies of Edward Tufte. The only thing I have changed is the background color to this nice beige ("inspired" by the Solarized Light theme). This beige is so much better than the horrid mustard yellow I had on the Squarespace blog, that haven't-drank-water-in-days-pee yellow. I thought about writing some styles to make the edges of the website look like pages in a book, but then I realized how stupid that is.</p>
      <p>The deployment of the website is actually pretty cool. I wanted to make it as easy as possible for others with minimal programming experience to be able to post, but without a backend, it's impossible to write some kind of live posting form. Instead, this blog lives within a <a href="https://github.com/justinpchang/blog">Github repository</a>, which is, in turn, hooked up for automatic deploys to Netlify. A local copy of the repository lives on my laptop within my Google Drive local directory. This way, people are able to write posts in the shared Google Drive directory, and my laptop will automatically pull updates from there, and then I can stage, commit, and push everything. I want to get this last step automated as well, so I'm playing around with writing a script that monitors updates and automatically pushes. That would be cool.</p>
      <br />
      <p><span class="newthought">All in all,</span> I'm pretty excited and hopeful this time around that it will actually stick. The website will probably go through many changes technically, but maybe it will become the time capsule I've always wanted. I also realize I haven't written at all about what will actually be here. That's mostly because I have no clue. Sofia had said she would post food blog stuff, so that's where the name came from. I guess we'll see about the rest.</p>
